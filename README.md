This is an old school project that I will be slowly doing a postmortem on. I am slowly adding new features and enhancing old ones. 

To run please do the following:
* **Download** release version 0.9
* **Compile** and **Run** both **jsh4.java** and **PipeThread.java** files found in Version 0.9
* current features:
  * cd, ls, cd, pwd, grep .. (in addition to other basic linux-based terminal commands)
  * able to run multiple commands with a pipe character " | " in between multiple arguments
  * CTRL + D to exit shell instance
  
* more features to come!!!  (awk, sed)
