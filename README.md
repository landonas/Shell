This is an old school project that I will be slowly doing a postmortem on. I am slowly adding new features and enhancing old ones. 

To run please do the following:
* **Download** both **jsh4.java** and **PipeThrad.java**
* **compile** and **run** both files
* current features:
  * cd, ls, cd .. (in addition to other basic linux-based terminal commands)
  * able to run multiple commands with a pipe character " | " in between arguments
  
* more features to come!!!
